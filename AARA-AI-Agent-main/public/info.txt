Explanation of Components
User Interface (Chatbot Frontend):

The user interacts with the chatbot by typing commands like "run getosdetails playbook".
The chatbot sends the command to chatbot.js.
chatbot.js:

Handles user input and determines the appropriate action.
Calls functions like executegetosdetailsPlaybook from playbook.js.
playbook.js:

Contains logic for sending API requests to the backend (server.js).
Sends the playbook name and inventory file to the /run-playbook endpoint.
server.js:

Backend server that processes API requests.
Resolves the playbook and inventory paths and executes the playbook using ansible-playbook.
Ansible:

Executes the specified playbook (e.g., getosdetails.yml) using the inventory file.
Produces output, such as system details or task results.
Output:

The playbook output is sent back to the frontend via the API.
The chatbot displays the results to the user.



Next Steps
Based on your info.txt file:

Add More Ansible Playbooks:

Create additional playbooks for different tasks and integrate them into the chatbot.
Test API:

Use tools like curl or Postman to test the /run-playbook endpoint.
Add Variations:

Add more commands and variations to the chatbot's predefined answers.
Integrate LLM API:

Use a language model API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for advanced chatbot responses.
User Authentication:

Implement username/password login functionality.
Dockerize the Application:

Create a Docker image for the application, push it to a server, and test it.
